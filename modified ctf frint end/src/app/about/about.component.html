    "<br><div align="right">The main aim of CEG Tech Forum is to create an informal community where CEG’s students can collaborate on ideas and projects. It is envisioned to be a place where there is no rigidity and where constant interaction between the seniors and juniors can be mutually beneficial.

This can be achieved only by the combined efforts of both the student directors and the students. If someone has an idea and doesn’t know how to go about it, he/she can always come to the CTF for pointers. There might not be anyone who is an expert in that domain, but we can always direct you to someone who might be able to help.

    "<br>Coming back to the question, yes, we are aware of CTF’s vision. I cannot talk about the past student directors, but I am sure that everyone knew CTF’s actual vision.

It is just that some teams have to start working for Kurukshetra as early as August, so the focus is more on the fest rather than the vision. This time we tried to create an interest among the juniors and that’s why we conducted an alumni talk + a coding contest + a quiz for first years<br><br>"</p>

      "<br><div>We are trying hard to balance the in-campus activities and the fest, Kurukshetra. We strongly believe that over the years, we will definitely be able to strike the balance between the two.

As far as the accomplishments are concerned, I accept that we have not done much. But it doesn’t mean that we have failed. We are trying to build a framework upon which someday, someone will be able to act and try to bring the actual vision into action. It just takes time, that’s all.<br><br>"</div></p>
